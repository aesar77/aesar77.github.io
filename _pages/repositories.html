<div class="repositories">
    <p>For my research, I developed luxetenebrae, captus and RubinsForge repositories.  </p>
    <h1>luxetenebrae</h1>
        Luxetenebrae, translates as 'the light and the darkness' from Ancient Latin, referring to the companion star and the black hole.
        Luxetenebrae is a stellar binary evolution and analysis pipeline based on COMPAS. It is designed to analyze the evolution of main sequence star â€“ black hole binaries which we consider as a background for the primordial black holes.
        <p>Luxetenebrae is available on <a href="https://github.com/AstroMusers/luxetenebrae">GitHub</a>.</p> 
   
    <h1>captus</h1>
        Captus ('captured') is a pipeline to estimate the galactic abundance of primordial black holes captured by main sequence stars as well as those bound states of black holes and stars that may form via other astrophysical pathways.
        Captus uses the N-body integrator Rebound and binary evolution code COMPAS.
    <p>Captus is available on <a href="https://github.com/AstroMusers/captus">GitHub</a>.</p>

    <h1>RubinsForge</h1>
        RubinsForge is a Python package that provides a set of tools for analyzing and visualizing data from the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).
        It is designed to facilitate the analysis of large datasets generated by the LSST, which will be used to study a wide range of astrophysical phenomena.
    <p>RubinsForge is available on <a href="https://github.com/AstroMusers/RubinsForge">GitHub</a>.</p>
