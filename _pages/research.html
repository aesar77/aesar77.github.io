    <p>My research mainly focuses on the dark matter problem. I approach this problem from two directions, primordial black holes and galaxy sub-halos. For primordial black holes, I investigate main sequence star â€“ black hole binaries. For sub-halos, I turn to galaxy-galaxy scale strong lenses.  </p>

    <p>Primordial black holes (PBHs) are black holes that formed in the early universe, before the formation of stars and galaxies. They are a compelling candidate for dark matter, if they can account for a significant fraction of the universe's mass without emitting light or radiation.</p>
