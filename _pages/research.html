    <p>My research mainly focuses on the dark matter problem. I approach this problem from two directions, primordial black holes and galaxy sub-halos. For primordial black holes, I investigate main sequence star – black hole binaries. For sub-halos, I turn to galaxy-galaxy scale strong lenses.  </p>

    <p>Primordial black holes (PBHs) are black holes that formed in the early universe, before the formation of stars and galaxies. They are a compelling candidate for dark matter, if they can account for a significant fraction of the universe's mass without emitting light or radiation.</p>

    <h1>Galaxy Sub-halos</h1>
    <p>Another approach to the dark matter is that they might be hidden in the galactic halos. In ΛCDM, gravity is the source that is responsible for the structure formation by hierarchical merging of smaller structures. Such structures are held in the gravitational potential well of the massive halo and referred to as sub-halos. </p>
